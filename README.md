# bash_scripts
A repo of beginner bash scripts from a crash course tutorial. I am keeping these for reference in future scripting and to have a lot of my beginner scripts :) Youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7BufAVwDiM&amp;list=WL&amp;index=2

These were coded in both Ubuntu and Kali Linux VM terminals.
